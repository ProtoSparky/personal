Many of the early cables failed, in part because the weight of a cable being laid on the bottom of the ocean would rip the cable in two. The <a href="https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Brett/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">first transatlantic cable project</a> that succeeded operated for only three months in 1858 before failing and could only send just over one word per minute.</p><p>But investors eager to cash in on rapid communications underwrote the development of better technology. Higher copper purity improved signal transmission, stronger sheathing reduced cable breaks, repeaters installed periodically along the cable boosted signal strength and polyethylene insulation replaced the earlier rubberlike material <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta-percha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">harvested from gutta-percha trees</a>.</p><p>Telephone calls eventually replaced telegraph messages, pushing technology further. A transatlantic cable installed in 1973 could handle 1,800 simultaneous conversations. In 1988, AT&amp;T installed the first transatlantic cable to use glass fiber optic strands instead of copper wires, an innovation that boosted capacity to 40,000 simultaneous phone calls.</p><figure edition="us" float="none" image-alt-text="A subsea internet cable, sliced to show a cross section of its fiber optic lines for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for insulation and protection." image-caption="&lt;p&gt;A subsea internet cable from manufacturer SubCom shows, from the center outward, its optical fibers for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for electrical insulation and protection.&lt;/p&gt;" image-credit="Stephen Shankland/CNET" image-date-created="2023/07/20" image-do-not-crop="false" image-do-not-resize="false" image-filename="20230719-subsea-internet-cable-closeup-photo-03.jpg" image-height="3272" image-watermark="false" image-width="5816" lightbox="false" size="large" uuid="3a1b38c6-df37-48db-a69e-6619e54ec2cd"><div><!-- --> <div><picture><source alt="A subsea internet cable, sliced to show a cross section of its fiber optic lines for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for insulation and protection." media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/90def45fb56ca4a895f0253cf6ec0f6bd691e27a/hub/2023/07/20/3a1b38c6-df37-48db-a69e-6619e54ec2cd/20230719-subsea-internet-cable-closeup-photo-03.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=768"/><source alt="A subsea internet cable, sliced to show a cross section of its fiber optic lines for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for insulation and protection." media="(max-width: 1023px)" srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/fd23aa905002c93a40e794666883a592eab857fe/hub/2023/07/20/3a1b38c6-df37-48db-a69e-6619e54ec2cd/20230719-subsea-internet-cable-closeup-photo-03.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1024"/><source alt="A subsea internet cable, sliced to show a cross section of its fiber optic lines for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for insulation and protection." media="(max-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/62836dd0ef01fca16ee5b821f9e73fb7a608c071/hub/2023/07/20/3a1b38c6-df37-48db-a69e-6619e54ec2cd/20230719-subsea-internet-cable-closeup-photo-03.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1200"/> <img alt="A subsea internet cable, sliced to show a cross section of its fiber optic lines for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for insulation and protection." height="675.1031636863825" loading="lazy" src="" width="1200"/> </picture></div> <!-- --> <!-- --></div> <figcaption><span><p>A subsea internet cable from manufacturer SubCom shows, from the center outward, its optical fibers for data transfer, steel cabling for strength, copper for power distribution and plastic for electrical insulation and protection.</p></span> <span>Stephen Shankland/CNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>SubCom's subsea cable factory dates back to its rope-making roots in the 1800s.

As with terrestrial fiber optic lines, using multiple frequencies of light — colors, to you and me — means more data can be sent at once. Network equipment ashore at either end of a cable encodes data into the light for transmission and decodes it after it's received.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-fiber-internet/" rel="follow">Fiber optics are great for fast broadband</a> and long-haul data transmission, but the technology has its limits. That's why there's a big bulge in the cable every 30 to 60 miles called a repeater, to boost the signal strength.</p><p>Repeaters require power, though, and that's where another part of the cable construction comes into play. Outside the fiber optic strands, a copper layer carries electricity at up to 18,000 volts. That's enough to power repeaters all the way across the Pacific Ocean just from one end of the cable, though power typically is available from both ends for greater reliability. </p><p>Why not keep raising the laser power, so you don't need repeaters as often?

That isn't as simple as unspooling your string when you're flying a kite on a windy day.</p><p>Fiber optic strands are narrow, but subsea cables are thicker, heavier and bulkier. They're stored in metal cylinders that wind and unwind the cables as they're moved from shore to ship or from ship to ship. A single ship's three "tanks" can hold 5,000 tons of cable, which works out to about 1,800 miles of lightweight cable and 600 miles of cable that's been armored for busy waters.</p><p>SubCom has to figure out the installation order for each cable segment and make sure that when installation begins, the right end of the cable is at the top of the coil. That means before loading onto the ship, while the cable is stored at SubCom's depot, it must be stored "flipped" the other way up. It reverses direction to the correct configuration as it's transferred loop by loop onto the ship, SubCom's Coughlan said.</p><p>That's already complicated, but weather, permits or other concerns can force changes to the installation order. That can require flipping a cable at sea with two ships side by side. In a very digital business it turns out to be a very analog problem trying to account for factors like the ships lurching on the open ocean and the cable's weight and bending limits.</p><p>"We have one guy in particular that's just a savant at this," Coughlan said.

Tonga, whose single subsea cable connection was severed by a volcanic eruption, is another example.</p><p>Human-caused climate change, which is creating more extreme storms, worries Microsoft's Rey. "What keeps me awake at night is large-scale climate events," he said. In 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hurricane Sandy</a> cut 11 of the 12 high-capacity cables that connected the US and Europe, he said.</p><p>Most cuts occur closer to land, where boat traffic is higher and water is shallower. There, cables are clad in metal armor and buried in the sea floor, but even so, cable cuts are a matter of when, not if. At any given moment, more than 10 cables are typically cut around the world, Google's Quigley said. The worst season for outages is October to December because of a combination of harsher weather and fishing activity.</p><p>Cable operators can pinpoint cable cut locations, but repair ships often must await government permits. Repairs average two weeks, Rey said, but three or four is common, according to.marine cable division chief Takahiro Sumimoto of Japanese telecommunications power NTT.

There's plenty of room for more optical fibers, but that approach is limited by the need for electrical power for the repeaters.</p><p>Today's new cables use 16 pairs of fibers, but a new cable that NTT is building between the US and Japan employs 20 fiber pairs to reach 350Gbps. Another Japanese tech giant, NEC, is using 24 fiber pairs to reach <a href="https://www.nec.com/en/press/202110/global_20211008_01.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speeds on its transatlantic cable to 500Tbps</a>, or a half petabit per second.</p><p>"Especially after the pandemic, we observed a capacity shortage everywhere. We urgently need to construct new cables," Sumimoto said. "The situation is a bit crazy. If we construct a cable, the capacity is immediately sold out."</p><p>Along with the new cable installations, sometimes older cables can be upgraded with new network hardware.

In December, it <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2022/12/09/microsoft-acquires-lumenisity-an-innovator-in-hollow-core-fiber-hcf-cable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">acquired a company called Lumenisity</a> developing hollow fibers with a tiny central tube of air. The speed of light in air is 47% faster than in glass, a reduction to the communication delay known as latency that's a key limit to network performance.</p><p>Transpacific cables have a latency of about 80 milliseconds. Cutting latency is important for time-sensitive computer interactions like financial transactions. Microsoft also is interested in hollow fibers for shorter-haul fiber optic lines, since lower latency effectively brings data centers closer together for faster fallback if one fails.</p><p>Also coming are fibers with multiple data transmission cores inside instead of just one. "We can't get much more improvement in bandwidth over a single fiber," TeleGeography's Mauldin said.</p><p>A portion of <a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/tpu-subsea-cable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google's TPU cable will use two-core fibers</a>, the company confirmed, but that's only a first step.
